## What it is

A self-hosted web app that turns the computer under your desk into a photo library, file manager, music player, audiobook reader and control panel. Open it from your phone or laptop. No accounts, no subscriptions, and your files stay on your machine.

## Run it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rxjdeep/reclmr.git ~/reclmr
cd ~/reclmr && ./install.sh
```

It sets everything up, then prints your **passcode** and the address to open. You need Linux or macOS and Python 3.10+. For your phone, add [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com). Windows is experimental and untested.

## What's inside

- **Gallery:** your camera roll and screenshots by day, with a full-screen viewer.
- **Files:** a Finder-style browser with upload, search and a Trash.
- **Music:** a player on top of [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org) with playlists, synced lyrics, two themes and a quality setting for mobile data.
- **Audiobooks:** PDF, JSON and TXT books with a voice that reads along.
- **AI:** chat through Ollama, images through ComfyUI, and a voice assistant.
- **Terminal:** a real shell in the browser, locked behind an authenticator-app code.
- **My Lab and Logs:** live stats for your machines, and a record of every sign-in and deletion.

Every part is optional. Anything that needs an outside service tells you what is missing.

## More

- [Setup](docs/SETUP.md): reaching it from your phone, the terminal code, every setting, updates.
- [Android apps](docs/ANDROID.md): the app and the phone backup.
- [Security](SECURITY_AUDIT.md): how it is locked down, and what is left.

It listens on localhost only, so you put a tunnel such as Tailscale Funnel in front of it. Sign-in uses a passcode, never kept in the browser. Every file path is checked. There is no telemetry; lyrics are looked up on LRCLIB (the artist and title only).

## Develop

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt && python -m pytest -q
```
